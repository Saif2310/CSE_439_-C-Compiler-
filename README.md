This is our submission of the Design of Compilers course in Ain Shams University faculty of Computer Engineering and Software Systems(CESS) During the Spring 23/24 semester.

The project is about implementing a mini-compiler to the C language, we're introduced to the core concepts of Syntax and Semantics of programming languages and putting them into action throughout the project , it enriches our experience with writing code and understanding key differences between many programming languages and programming language abstraction levels. In this project we use C++ with a simple input GUI made using QT(QMake library) to cover the main branches of C code (eg. Assignment, Conditionals, Looping).
